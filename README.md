This is a biographical/resume website for the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.

What I aim to learn with this project:
- neon buttons with reflection upon button hover
- parallax aesthetic
- sliding content sections, upon button click
- to make an overlay animation of the entire screen upon button hover
- contact form
- background/section slideshow of images
- responsive design for mobile devices
- get a domain & website name, if possible
